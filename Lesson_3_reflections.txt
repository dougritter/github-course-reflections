When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work in another machine that is not mine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I can like to suffer. Just kidding.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone that I do on my GitHub account.
A clone is a copy of a repository, that maintains its history.
A branch is a place on a repository that can be or not equals of the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
To avoid conflicts with code out-of-dated.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?
GitHub has pull requests, a very good feature that allows us to make effective
code reviews in our projects. The dificulty is pratically the same.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly 
in master? What benefits does each approach have?
All the time. In master we can maintain a version of the code ready to production.
The other features we can implement on other branches and merge when it was
tested and aproved for new release version.
