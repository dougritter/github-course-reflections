How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
Verifying the new line (added) immediately after the old line.
It's a good practice, do not write lines with more than 80 columns.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
With this history, I will not need to maintain backups of my files. Also I'll
be able to delete all the commented and unnecessary code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because in a project, each file can depend on other files, that need to be
committed together.
