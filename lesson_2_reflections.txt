What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The git creates a .git directory. We need to do it because by default this folder
does not exist.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area defines wich files will be commited to the repository. Its value
is separate the files that are done to be committed from the others.
