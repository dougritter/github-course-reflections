What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The git creates a .git directory. We need to do it because by default this folder
does not exist.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area defines wich files will be commited to the repository. Its value
is separate the files that are done to be committed from the others, because
the staging area only maintains files not modified after addition.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Adding to stage only files that refers to that logical code change. As soon as
files were added and finished the changes, it is needed to do a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
When a new feature is implemented and is needed that the current features do not
be modified.
