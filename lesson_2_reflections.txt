does not exist.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area defines wich files will be commited to the repository. Its value
is separate the files that are done to be committed from the others, because
the staging area only maintains files not modified after addition.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Adding to stage only files that refers to that logical code change. As soon as
files were added and finished the changes, it is needed to do a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

be modified.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
With the diagrams, I can see the outdated branches and prevent losting changes.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it 
in the diagram the way we do?
The result is only one branch with the result of the two branches and also with
the commits history of the two branches.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
